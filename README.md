# Precise Localization Method for Faulty Idlers in Belt Conveyors Based on Visual and Auditory Bimodal Fusion

## Overview
This paper presents a precise localization method for faulty idlers that integrates image and audio multimodal information. The proposed method in this paper overcomes the limitations of current unimodal monitoring methods based on sound, temperature, or vibration.

### Key Features
- Belt Conveyor, Idler Fault, Multimodal Detection
